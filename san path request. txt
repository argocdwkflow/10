Request for SAN / Multipathing Audit – Server Unresponsiveness on Jan 6th, 2026
Short description
Request for SAN / Multipathing / Storage Path audit following server unresponsiveness on January 6th, 2026 at 04:10.
Description
Dear Team,
We are requesting a storage/SAN/multipathing audit following an incident observed on a physical Dell server running RHEL 7, which became unresponsive on January 6th, 2026 at approximately 04:10.
Between 04:10 and 09:37, the server remained powered on but unresponsive, producing no operating system logs or monitoring metrics. Normal activity resumed only after a hardware-level reset, at which point the system rebooted successfully.
Observed behavior
No OS logs (rsyslog, journald, kernel) generated between 04:15 and 09:37
Monitoring data (CPU, memory, disk, network) stopped abruptly at ~04:10
Disk I/O and IOPS dropped to near zero during the incident window
No kernel panic, OOM, or application-level errors detected
After recovery, kernel logs report multiple
“Power-on or device reset occurred” events on storage devices
All filesystems (XFS) mounted normally after reboot
This behavior is consistent with a storage or I/O path freeze, where the operating system is unable to complete or log I/O operations.
Suspected scope (to be confirmed)
We suspect a potential issue involving one or more of the following components:
SAN backend or storage array
Fibre Channel / iSCSI fabric
Zoning or routing between the storage array and the server
HBA adapters or firmware
Multipathing (path loss, path freeze, or queueing)
No conclusive evidence points to an OS, kernel, or application failure.
Request
We kindly request your team to:
Perform a detailed audit of the SAN, storage paths, and fabric
Review storage array logs, fabric logs, and HBA-related events
Check for any maintenance, failover, firmware events, or path disruptions
Confirm whether any anomaly occurred around January 6th, 2026 between 04:00 and 09:30
Provide the root cause analysis and any corrective / preventive recommendations
Impact
Server unavailable/unresponsive for several hours
Manual hardware reset required to restore service
No data corruption observed post-recovery
Attachments / Evidence available
OS logs before and after the incident
Monitoring graphs (CPU, memory, disk, I/O)
Kernel messages after reboot
Timeline reconstruction
Please let us know if additional data is required from the OS side.
Thank you for your support.
Kind regards,
Linux Production Team (N3)
👉 Si tu veux, je peux aussi :
Adapter le ticket pour un Storage Vendor (Dell / EMC / NetApp / IBM / HPE)
Le raccourcir pour un incident P2/P3
Ajouter une timeline ITIL ou un business impact section
Reformuler pour éviter toute sensibilité politique entre équipes
